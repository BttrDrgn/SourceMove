# Unity Source Movement
Based on Fragsurf by cr4yz (Jake E.), available here: https://github.com/AwesomeX/Fragsurf-Character-Controller/

A full adaptation of Source engine's movement mechanics in Unity, including strafe jumping, surfing, bunnyhopping, swimming, crouching and jump-crouching (optional), as well as sliding (optional). The player can also push around (and be pushed around by) rigidbodies.

You can use the included 'Example player prefab' as a base, or just add SurfCharacter to an empty object and do the looking/aiming system yourself.
